"""
Naming conventions:
- Functions, variables, and methods: lowercase_with_underscores (snake_case).
- Classes: CapitalizedWords (CamelCase).
- Constants: ALL_UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES.

Whitespace:
- Avoid extraneous spaces inside parentheses, brackets, or braces.
- No spaces before commas, semicolons, or colons.
- Use a single space after commas, semicolons, or colons.
= No extra whitespace at the end of lines or before argument lists.

Line breaks:
- Prefer breaking lines inside parentheses, brackets, or braces rather than using backslashes.
- When breaking around binary operators, place the operator at the beginning of the new line.

Programming recommendations:
- Avoid extraneous whitespace at the end of lines.
- Use blank lines to separate logical sections of code.
- Prefer consistency within a project, even over strict adherence to PEP 8, if it improves readability.

General principle: Code is read much more often than it is written; prioritize readability and maintainability.
