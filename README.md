# Introduction
Leetcode.com is a website where people–mostly software engineers–practice their coding skills. There are 1800+ questions (and growing), each with multiple solutions. Questions are ranked by level of difficulty: easy, medium, and hard. 

I am trying to do some competetive programming during my freetime and I also love solving coding question and I find one of the best way to practice is to solve problems on Leetcode. On my free time, I usually try to solve 1 or 2 questions. What I do is try to exaustively find all the possible solution I can come up with within a reasonable amount of time (unless the question really bugs me). 

# How to use this 
Use it as a reference for solution & thinking patterns.

# Project structure
## Folder structure
I categorizes all the questions I solve based on languages I used (wether is Golang, Java or sth else). Within each folders, I try to categorize the questions by problems type or common keywords of method & algorithm used to solve the questions. You will see things like `sorting`, `graph`, `dynamic programming`, etc..

## File structure
On top of the file, beside the common overhead specifics to languages, you will see a comments section that note down the question number (on leetcode), the link to the online version of the question and my concept, ideas for solving the question. Bellow that is the most optimized version I can think of in the time I solve the question.
